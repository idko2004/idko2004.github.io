	[
		"You hang around for a living.\nSomewhere between all the land and the sky.",
		"Birds may believe at a distance.\nYou wear a grin and keep perfectly still.\nDriven away with persistence.",
		"I wonder if they have wondered or will ever wonder",
		"I wonder whether he wonders if you ever wonder",
		"Oh, scarecrow, maybe the wind knows.\nWhether you wonder who's calling your name.",
		"Scarecrow, maybe the wind knows.\nWhether you wonder if you are to blame",
		"Saving the grain of your golden domain. Without even reasoning why.",
		"The crows seem to know where you need them to go.\nIgniting a spark in their minds.\nSo they circle and fly."
