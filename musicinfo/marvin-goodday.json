		"I'd like to say hello and welcome you, good day, that is my name.",
		"Everyone loves a potato monkey...",
		"I stepped on gum! I stepped on gum! Ohoho!",
		"Looking through glass eyes, give it a few tries.\nNothing goes right in its time.\nKill all its bad dreams, wonder 'bout no things.\nCircles and spirals in mind",
		"Let us sing, let us sing.\nLet us sing, let us sing.\nLet us sing, let us sing.\nLet us sing, let us sing.\nLet us sing, let us sing.\nLet us sing, let us sing.\nLet us sing, let us sing.\nLet us sing, let us sing.\nLet us sing, let us sing"
