	[
		"I made you these construction paper dolls.\nConnected by the hands with tiny little faces.\nAnd now I'll hang them on the walls.\nSo you can see the people filling up the spaces.",
		"I think I am the only one to ever realize that I am.\nThe only one to realize what's true.\nWhen all the world is stuck in a jam:\nThe sky is not blue",
		"Will my sea monkeys go to hell?",
		"I might have stated what I thought before.\nI might have kept it in, my memory is failing.\nI might have stumbled through the door.\nYou might have stared and asked what I had been inhaling.",
		"I'm setting up my tiny little town.\nA Lego set in which I'm planning to retire.\nIt's really time I settled down.\nBut not before I set everything on fire.",
		"They tell me things I can't deny.\nThey tell me I'm a sap, I'm a square.\nThey tell me things I already knew.\nThe greatest of the secrets they share:\nThe sky is not blue."
