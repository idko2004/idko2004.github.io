	[
		"Indefinite and definitely dreamed about there's something.",
		"There's something making noise.",
		"Some terrible kaleidoskull\nThat ever so gently destroys\nThe minds of those who believe it.",
		"Now there's a lightbulb at the bottom of the sea. It's glowing.",
		"It's like sunlight, the upside-downness of it... It's saying something.",
		"I can tell it's there by the way it's not quite there."
