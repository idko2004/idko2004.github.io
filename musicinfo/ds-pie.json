		"There lived a merchant in the days of old.\nWho is remembered for the things he sold.\nNo silly trinkets, silver, bronze, or gold.\nSo I'm told, so I'm told.",
		"He made a most delicious pumpkin pie.\nWhich he presented to the passersby.\nBefore the sun set he'd be all but dry.\nFolks would buy the whole supply.",
		"He lived alone, (He lived alone.).\nAnd every night he sat upon a throne of pumpkin pie.\nI do not know his name. (He'd never say his name.).\nHe never wanted all the fame that came with pumpkin pie.",
		"Before you knew it he was in full swing.\nHis pumpkin pies became the next big thing.\nSoon he was called upon to feed the king.\nAnd they'd sing, feed the king."
