		"Burger King fries on a dashboard underneath the burning hot sun.",
		"Serpentine alarm clock, ringing up a horrid little kamikaze ding-ding-a-ding-ding-a-ding.",
		"Nana korobi ya oki.\nRo-ma wa ichinichi ni shite narazu, baby",
		"I don't know my way around.\nBut if I follow every sound.\nA new way out is soon surrounding me",
		"And lo and behold, the very next morning.\nThey climbed out of bed and gazed out upon the morning world.\nAnd to their complete and utter amazement.\nIt had not snowed at all.\nThe end.",
		"Don't mean to bug, but I thought I'd tell you that your shoes are untied.",
		"Oh, running 'round in circles like a Chupacabra Capybara."
