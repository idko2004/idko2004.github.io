	[
		"To leave from this tale, follow closely ahead.",
		"Prepare to exist by the living & dead.",
		"Too slow or too kind or too wary of those too at ease.",
		"Continued through mirrors left broken to sing and be heard.\nThrough when it seems all the senses are lost to absurd",
		"So the part where we are.\nTrapped in active depart.\nIn the fate of the stars.",
		"No, not one who we are.\nNo control pumping heart.\nButton pressed mind in art.\nMind control, mind restart.",
		"To leave from the present with no source of sound.\nThey laugh because silence is never around.",
		"Give & take & sleep & wake & pray for day & night to come."
