		"Nobody's cool as we.\nNor quite as esoterically far out.\nWe're so far out it's creepy",
		"They have no roses.\nSubconsciously they envy us a lot",
		"And when they hear our favorite bands, they wish that they were geeks in love.",
		"As far as I can tell.\nWhile other lovers go through hell.\nWe'll know we're too cool for damnation.",
		"When they see us on the street, they wish that they were geeks in love.",
		"And when they hear us trick or treat, they wish that they were geeks in love.",
		"Geekity-geekity-geeks in love."
