		"There's lots of pretty people here sharing sotries and passing letters and.\nThere's lots of questions answered and metaphysical astronomical songs.\nWords printed all on papers that seem too mystical, it's so magical.\nPeople that dance and compute that no one's better than you.",
		"Please don't just laugh and clap right now, this is serious, I'm not delirious.\nI've waited very patiently just to let you know who should run the show.\n'Cause we all know these are the facts, nothing to retract, nothing too abstract.\nConcluding in this song, I'll say: no one's better than you.\nNo one's better than you."
