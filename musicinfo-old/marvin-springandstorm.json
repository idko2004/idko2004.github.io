		"One time, I tried to sing.\nAbout spring and a storm.\nBut you know how it goes.\n\"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah-blah, blah\"\nAll along.\nWon't you please stop complaining?\nI'm playing a song.",
		"But all the rain comes down the same.\nFalling to from where it came.\nOn the ground and back around up into the sky.",
		"We have so much left to sing.\nThere's a storm for every spring.\nAll you see and you and me became from a star.",
		"You're a star, you're a star.\nYou're a star, you're a star.\nYou're a star, you're a star.",
		"Silent explosive and silent explosive and silent explosive and silent explosive.",
		"Create until nothing is left to create.\nAnd the universe bursts with an overworked sigh.\nAnd pretend to, pretend to recrown the creation.\nAnd sing the same thing 'til the clouds start to cry.\nAnd then over and over and over again.\nAnd then over and over and never again."
