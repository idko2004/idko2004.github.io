		"I love my brine shrimp pals, they are my friends.\nI watch them float around inside their tank.",
		"But when I came back home from school today.\nMy little friends were dead and I was sad.",
		"The other day they were alive.\nAnd now they're floating at the top.\nI knew they wouldn't last forever.\nAnd now they're just a bunch of dead sea monkeys.",
		"Will my sea monkeys go to heaven?",
		"Will my sea monkeys go to hell?",
		"I miss 'em, I miss 'em, me oh my!\nI miss 'em, I miss 'em, me oh my!\nI miss 'em, I miss 'em, me oh my!\nI miss 'em, I miss 'em, me oh my!"
