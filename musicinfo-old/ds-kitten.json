		"My kitten, my kitty cat.\nWhen she's content she purrs.\nShe thinks the house is hers.\nBut you won't like her when she's angry.\nNo, you won't like her when she's angry.\nAngry, angry.",
		"Kitten is angry, kitten is offended.\nFur standing out and little claws extended.",
		"Don't touch her, don't look at her.\nMy kitten knows tae kwon do.\nShe can take you out, I know.\nI've seen it before and it's not pretty.\nShe's really one ferocious kitty cat now.",
		"She's deadly, she'll hurt you.\nShe'll show you endless pain.\nHer little whiskers are stained with the blood of those that she has slain.\nBelieve me, she will go insane.\nShe will go insane."
