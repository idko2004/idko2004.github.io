		"Rotary Park is safe after dark",
		"Rotary Park is the jam after dark",
		"Be, leave and decide, stay and be blind",
		"We nearly died, be that inside",
		"Rotary Park is at peace after dark",
		"Rotary Park is ablaze after dark",
		"Rotary Park is swell after dark",
		"This morning I woke from a nightmare and fell out of bed",
		"and Lo! the ghost of a man ages thought to be dead",
		"Rotary Park is a gas before dusk"
