	[
		"Lately I've not been feeling so good.\nLike I'm just random knots in wood.\nI'm careful where I crawl.\nIf nothing else at all.",
		"Some friends come by at seven 'o clock.\nThey ask if I'll go out for a walk.\nI tell them not today.\nBut they take me anyway.",
		"Now won't you tell me why I feel so scatterbrained?\nThe moon still hasn't come back since it's waned.\nIt can't be what I'm looking for.\nI'm thinking but I don't know, oh, oh."
