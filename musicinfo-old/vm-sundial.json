		"Somehow something set my sundial backwards, tilted, and upside-down.",
		"I think I think I am unsure of what to say.",
		"Live long and prosper while the winter melts away.",
		"I've got Anubis on my back and something in my shoe.",
		"Don't walk backwards, don't be jealous.",
		"I cease to see you when I start to shut my eyes."
