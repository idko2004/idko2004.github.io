		"That's the beauty of it. It doesn't do anything.",
		"Lost in solipsism\nHe then slowly pulls a lever\nWhich sets off a mechanism\nWhich does nothing whatsoever\nBut the nothing that it does\nNegates the everything we know\nBecause it's screaming just because\nBecause it's neither friend or foe\nAnd so we label it a menace\nOr a grandiose work of art\nFrom its finale to its genesis\nWe slowly pull it all apart."
